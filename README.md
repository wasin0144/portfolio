1001-Experiments currently has the following four datasets with four months of data:
 - "user_health_data.csv" which logs daily health metrics, habits and data from wearable devices,
 - "supplement_usage.csv" which records details on supplement intake per user,
 - "experiments.csv" which contains metadata on experiments, and
 - "user_profiles.csv" which contains demographic and contact information of the users.

Each dataset contains unique identifiers for users and/or their supplement regimen.

The developers and data scientsits currently manage code that cross-references all of these data sources separately, which is cumbersome and error-prone.

Your manager has asked you to write a Python function that cleans and merges these datasets into a single dataset.

The final dataset should provide a comprehensive view of each user's health metrics, supplement usage, and demographic information.

- To test your code, your manager will run only the code `merge_all_data('user_health_data.csv', 'supplement_usage.csv', 'experiments.csv', 'user_profiles.csv')`
- Your `merge_all_data` function must return a DataFrame, with columns as described below.
- All columns must accurately match the descriptions provided below, including names.
